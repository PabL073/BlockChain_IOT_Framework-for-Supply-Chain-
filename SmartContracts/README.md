# Blockchain IoT Supply Chain Framework

## Smart Contracts in Development

### Provenance.sol
_A smart contract in development for the Blockchain and IoT Supply Chain framework, `Provenance.sol` is dedicated to capturing and securely storing the provenance data of products. It aims to provide immutable and transparent historical data to stakeholders, verifying the authenticity and origin of products, which is crucial in combating counterfeit goods and ensuring quality control._

### Tracking.sol
_The `Tracking.sol` smart contract is under development as a part of the Blockchain and IoT Supply Chain framework. Its function is to facilitate real-time tracking of goods throughout the supply chain. This contract will enable stakeholders to monitor product movement, optimize logistics, log keeping conditions (temperature, humidity, geo-location), create product's route history and improve accountability by providing a live and auditable trail of goods from manufacturer to end-user._
